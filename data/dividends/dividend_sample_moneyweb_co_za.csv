1,2021-11-19 04:00:57,TIGER BRANDS LIMITED – Tiger Brands audited group results and dividend declaration for the year ended 30 September 2021,"Declaration of final dividend

The Board has declared a final ordinary dividend of 506 cents per share for the year

ended 30 September 2021. This, together with the interim ordinary dividend of 320

cents per share, brings the total dividend for the year to 826 cents. In view of the

company’s ungeared balance sheet and strong cash generating ability, it has been

decided to determine this year’s total dividend on the company’s adjusted headline

earnings. Consequently, HEPS was adjusted to exclude the impact of the product

recall and the civil unrest, which took place in July this year. The Company’s

dividend policy of 1.75x cover has therefore been applied to HEPS after the

aforementioned adjustments.


In accordance with paragraphs 11.17 (a) (i) to (x) and 11.17 (c) of the JSE Listings

Requirements, the following additional information is disclosed:


   •   The ordinary final dividend has been declared out of income reserves
